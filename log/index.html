      <abstract>
        In Part IV of this class, we&rsquo;ll &ldquo;prototype&rdquo; a logic programming language
        that is similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a>. We&rsquo;ll do
        this with an interpreter, just like you did for the functional language in
        <a href="../func/index.html">Homeworks 1 and 2</a>.

        <p>
          Alan Kay likes to talk about moving from &ldquo;how&rdquo; to &ldquo;what&rdquo; in
          programming. That is, we&rsquo;d like the programmer to merely specify <em>what</em> is
          desired and have the computer automagically make it so, as opposed to requiring he or she
          to detail every step required to get there. In a nutshell, this move from
          &ldquo;how&rdquo; to &ldquo;what&rdquo; is the story of progress in programming languages
          over time. Even low-level languages like C provide several forms of &ldquo;what&rdquo; as
          compared with assembly language, e.g., &ldquo;let there be a variable called
          <code>x</code>,&rdquo; &ldquo;return back to my caller,&rdquo; etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prolog can in some ways be viewed as the idea of a &ldquo;what&rdquo; language taken to
          its <em>logical</em> <sidebar>(Pun intended.)</sidebar> <em>conclusion</em>: programming
          by specifying. In Prolog, a programmer simply specifies an <em>ontology</em>: a set of
          entities and their relationships to one another, defined as a set of logical rules. In
          class, for example, we saw a simple Prolog program whose entities were CS courses at
          UCLA with a prerequisite relationship defined among them. All computation is performed by
          answering queries about what is true according to this ontology. Prolog answers queries by
          searching for a <em>proof</em> (or <em>derivation</em>) using the rules of the ontology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, Prolog does not put programming language designers out of business. By
          forcing everything to be a &ldquo;what&rdquo; and all computation to proceed via search,
          many kinds of tasks are unnatural to implement and/or require careful structuring to
          ensure that Prolog&rsquo;s search will terminate. Further, tasks often require the use of
          imperative features to obtain reasonable performance. (So don&rsquo;t worry, you can still
          invent the ultimate &ldquo;what&rdquo; language!)
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, Prolog continues to be an inspiration for what declarative programming might
          be. Further, subsets of Prolog, notably
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog">Datalog</a>, which requires the arguments
          to predicates to be simple atoms rather than arbitrary terms, have been quite successful
          in a variety of domains, e.g., access control, program analysis, and data analytics.
          Datalog provides many of the benefits of Prolog but without the fragility: all Datalog
          programs are guaranteed to terminate, and the semantics of a Datalog program is completely
          independent of the underlying search strategy that is used by an implementation.

          <span>Part I: Manipulating Variables</span>
        </sectionHeader>
        <p>
	  In the first part of this assignment, you will implement a couple of helper methods that
          will be used by your interpreter.
        </p>
        <h3>Freshening Up</h3>
        <p>
	  Implement a method on <code>Rule</code>s called <code>makeCopyWithFreshVarNames()</code>.
          This method should return a copy of the rule in which all variable names have been
          replaced with fresh variable names. As we discussed in class, you will want to call this
          method before unifying a goal with the head of a rule so that the variable names in the
          rule don&rsquo;t accidentally get confused with the variable names in the goal (and in the
          surrounding context).
        </p>
        <h3 id="rewrite">Applying Substitutions</h3>
        <p>
	  Unification produces a <em>substitution</em>, which is a mapping from variables to
          <highlight><em>terms</em></highlight>.
          <sidebar>
            As shown in the grammar above, a <em>term</em> is either a variable or a clause. Note
            that the arguments to a clause are themselves arbitrary terms.
          </sidebar>
          In your interpreter, substitutions will be represented as instances of the
          <code>Subst</code> class, which is declared in
          <a href="classes.js"><code>classes.js</code></a> and supports the following methods:
          <ul>
	    <li>
              <code>lookup(varName)</code> returns the term associated with <code>varName</code>
              in the substitution, or <code>undefined</code> if <code>varName</code> is not
              associated with a term.
            </li>
	    <li>
              <code>bind(varName, term)</code> updates the substitution in place to associate
              <code>varName</code> with <code>term</code>, and returns the substitution.
            </li>
	    <li>
              <code>clone()</code> returns a copy of the substitution.
            </li>
	  </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
	  As mentioned in class, a substitution should always be in <em>solved form</em>: any
          variable that appears in its domain should not appear in its range. You will have to
          figure out how to maintain this invariant in your interpreter. To make this task easier,
          implement a method on terms &mdash; i.e., on <code>Var</code>s and <code>Clause</code>s
          &mdash; called <code>rewrite(s)</code> such that <code>t.rewrite(s)</code> returns the
          result of applying the substitution <code>s</code> to term <code>t</code>. In other words,
          <code>rewrite</code> will replace any variables in <code>t</code> with their values
          according to <code>s</code>, and leave any variables that are not mapped in
          <code>s</code> alone. (Note that the result of <code>t.rewrite(s)</code> is a new term
          &mdash; the <code>rewrite</code> method should not modify its receiver.)
        </p>
        <h3>Unit Tests</h3>
        <p>
          Please do all your work in a file called <a href="log.js"><code>log.js</code></a>. Each
          time you refresh this page, that file is loaded by our test harness to run unit tests for
          each part of the assignment.
        </p>

        <script src="tests-part1.js"></script>

      </section>
      <section>
        <sectionHeader>
          <span>Part II: Unification</span>
        </sectionHeader>
        <p>
	  As discussed in class, the heart of a Prolog interpreter is <em>unification</em>.
          Implement a method on <code>Subst</code> called <code>unify(term1, term2)</code> that
          adds to the given substitution whatever bindings are necessary in order to unify the given
          terms. If unification succeeds, <code>unify</code> should return the updated substitution;
          otherwise it should throw an exception like this:
          <codeBlock>throw new Error('unification failed');</codeBlock>
          The resulting substitution should be in solved form; the <code>rewrite</code> method
          that you implemented <a href="#rewrite">above</a> should come in handy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the pseudocode for unification that we saw in class.
          <sidebar>
            Recall that unification produces the <em>most general unifier</em> of two terms, which
            is always unique. Intuitively, <code>s</code> is the most general unifier of
            <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code> if any other unifier <code>s'</code> of those terms
            is simply a more constrained version of <code>s</code>, i.e. it has all the constraints
            of <code>s</code> plus potentially more. For example, <code>{X:a,Y:a}</code> is a more
            constrained version of <code>{X:Y}</code>.
          </sidebar>
          Your implementation will be conceptually similar, except that it will imperatively update
          a given substitution as it goes rather than returning a new substitution.
          Also, make sure to implement the <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occurs_check">occurs check</a>,
    which is not shown below.

          produces the solutions for a given program. The solutions should be returned as an
          <em>iterator</em> of substitutions, each representing a solution to the query in the
          program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, an iterator is just an object that has a <code>next()</code> method. This method
          will either return an instance of <code>Subst</code>, or a <em>falsy</em> value to tell
          the caller that there are no more solutions. Solutions should be produced in the same
          order as they are in Prolog. Our test harness and playground will use your iterator to
          obtain and print solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Note</b>: The produced substitutions can include more variables than those that appear
          in the query; our provided <code>evalAST</code> method
          (see <a href="classes.js"><code>classes.js</code></a>) filters each substitution to find
          and print only the variables that appear in the query.
        </p>
        <p>
          To handle programs that have an infinite (or just a very large) number of solutions, you
          should produce solutions <em>lazily</em>, i.e., you should only actually search for the
          next solution when <code>next()</code> is called on your returned iterator. So your
          <code>solve</code> method will really just produce an iterator that &ldquo;knows&rdquo;
          how to search for the next solution whenever it is asked for one. This will require you
          to maintain some state to represent the current point in your search, so that a call to
          <code>next()</code> can pick up where the previous call left off, including accounting
          for the need to backtrack. <em>Hint: Aren&rsquo;t lexically scoped closures great?</em>

              Modify the <a id="pageSourceAnchor">parser</a> to add number literals to our language,
              then extend your prototype with support for arithmetic via the <code>is/2</code>
              predicate. E.g., <code>is(X, +(15, *(3, 9)))</code> should succeed with <code>X</code>
              bound to <code>42</code>. For extra style points, make it possible for the arithmetic
              operators to be written in infix notation, with the standard precedences.

              Prolog finds solutions to a query by doing a depth-first search. Experiment with a
              different search strategy, e.g., breadth-first. What are the benefits and
              disadvantages of your alternative semantics?
