          Object-oriented languages (including JavaScript) have primitive support for <em>dynamic
          dispatch</em>, which automatically chooses the best method to invoke at run time, based on
          the class of the receiver. You made use of this feature to good effect in
          <a href="../func/index.html">Homeworks 1 and 2</a>. For example, the
          <highlight><code>eval</code></highlight>
          <sideBar>You may have used a different name, e.g., <code>interp</code>.</sideBar>
          method of a <code>BinOp</code> AST node can simply invoke
          <code>this.e1.eval(&hellip;)</code> to recursively evaluate its first operand, without
          having to manually figure out the right <code>eval</code> method implementation for it;
          rather, each kind of node just &ldquo;knows&rdquo; how to evaluate itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sideBar>
            Including the language you implemented in
            <a href="../func/index.html#hw2">Homework 2</a>.
          </sideBar>
          However, dynamic dispatch has some important limitations when compared to a general
          mechanism for <em>pattern matching</em>, as supported by many <highlight>functional
          languages</highlight>:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Dynamic dispatch can only be used at the &ldquo;top level&rdquo; of a method, to
              determine which method implementation to invoke.  For example, suppose the code for
              the method described above needs to behave differently based on the kind of value
              <code>v</code> that is returned by the call <code>this.e1.eval(&hellip;)</code>. To use
              dynamic dispatch, our only option is to create a new method <code>evalHelper</code>
              with implementations for each kind of value, and invoke <code>v.evalHelper()</code>
              inside <code>BinOp</code>&rsquo;s implementation of <code>eval</code>. This approach
              is heavyweight and breaks up the logic of the original method in a potentially
              unnatural way &mdash; so much so that it is common for programmers to instead resort
              to manual dispatch through <code>instanceof</code> tests.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dynamic dispatch does not support many useful features of pattern matching, such as
              &ldquo;deep&rdquo; pattern matching on the structure of an object and tests on
              primitive values (e.g., an integer that is equal to <code>5</code>).
            </li>
            <li>
              In a language that supports <highlight><em>single dispatch</em></highlight>
              <sideBar> &hellip; as opposed to <em>multiple-dispatch</em>.</sideBar> &mdash;
              the majority of mainstream OO languages! &mdash; dynamic dispatch only gives
              programmers a declarative way to implement different behaviors based on the class of
              the receiver. There is no easy way to dispatch based on the classes of the arguments
              of a method.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, one solution to this problem is to simply switch to a language that already
          supports pattern matching, like the one you implemented in Homework 2. But changing
          languages is not always an option:
          <ul>
            <li>
              It may be that you&rsquo;re using several libraries that are only available in
              JavaScript (or whatever language you are currently using), and it&rsquo;s too much
              effort to reimplement all of that functionality in another language;
            </li>
            <li>
  	      You may also be using several tools that are tightly coupled with JavaScript, such as
              a special development environment, debugger, etc. There is a high cost to losing all
              of these tools and having to find appropriate replacements.
            </li>
            <li>
              <sideBar>
                By &ldquo;obscure&rdquo; we mean anything that&rsquo;s not Java or C++&hellip;
                <em>maybe</em> C#, too.
              </sidebar>
              Or maybe your boss isn&rsquo;t happy with the idea of an &ldquo;obscure&rdquo;
              language creeping into the company&rsquo;s code base, because you&rsquo;ll eventually
              move on and she will have to find someone else who can maintain the
              code. This kind of thing is a real concern in industry.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          An increasingly popular solution to this problem is to provide the desired abstraction in
          the form of an <em>internal domain-specific language (DSL)</em>. This name is important,
          so let&rsquo;s break it down:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Internal</em> means that it lives inside a host language, as opposed to being a
              language that you can use on its own.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Domain-specific</em> means that it&rsquo;s focused on a particular problem, as
              opposed to general-purpose.
            </li>
          </ul>
          In other words, an internal DSL extends an existing language with new features that
          provide increased expressiveness, security, performance, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Internal DSLs (usually) don&rsquo;t have their own syntax; instead they have a
          carefully-designed API in the host language that feels somewhat natural to write, and
          makes for readable code. Designing such an API is not easy, and some host languages are
          better than others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)">Haskell</a>, and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)">Scala</a> are all
          reasonably good host languages. C not so much, though its macro system can be used to
          implement some limited kinds of DSLs. Java is basically awful as a host language.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what should you look for in a host language?
          <ul>
            <li>
              It helps if the language is <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression-oriented_programming_language">expression-oriented</a></b>,
              i.e., if nearly everything the programmer ever writes is an expression that yields a
              value. The uniformity of this style of language makes it easier to extend, in contrast
              to a language that has rigid distinctions among different syntactic categories (e.g.,
              between expressions and statements).
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Support for first-class functions, especially if the syntax is lightweight.</b>
              First-class functions are critical for implementing new control structures, new kinds
              of modularity mechanisms, and more. See the original
              <a href="http://library.readscheme.org/page1.html">Lambda the Ultimate&hellip;</a>
              papers for good examples of this kind of thing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Operator overloading.</b> If you were using an internal DSL for matrix arithmetic,
              would you rather have to write <code>aMatrix.times(anotherMatrix)</code> or
              <code>aMatrix * anotherMatrix</code>?
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Garbage collection and finalizers</b> make it possible for the implementation of a
              DSL to clean up after itself (deallocate data structures, close files, etc.) without
              burdening the programmer.

          at 11:30pm</span><br>

        </due>
        <p style="text-indent: 0;">
          For homework 3, you&rsquo;ll implement an internal DSL for pattern matching in JavaScript.
          Here&rsquo;s an example of how this DSL could be used to implement a <code>zip</code>
          function, which turns two lists into a list of pairs, assuming we have declared
          classes <code>Nil</code> and <code>Cons</code> to implement linked lists:
	  <codeBlock>function zip(l1, l2) {
  return match([l1, l2],
    [instof(Nil), instof(Nil)], 
      () => new Nil(),
    [instof(Cons,_,_), instof(Cons,_,_)],
      (x, xs, y, ys) => new Cons([x,y], zip(xs,ys)) 
  );
}</codeBlock>
          Pattern matching with this DSL may not be as nice as doing it in a language that has
          native support for pattern matching, but it sure beats deconstructing the objects
          manually. The resulting code is both more readable (once you get used to the syntax) and
          less error-prone.
        </p>
        <h2>Description of the DSL</h2>
        <h3>The <code>match</code> function</h3>
        <p>
          Our DSL consists of a <code>match</code> function whose arguments are a value to be
          matched, followed by zero or more (pattern, function) pairs:
          <codeBlock>match(value, pat1, fun1, pat2, fun2, &hellip;)</codeBlock>
          <code>match</code> will try to match the value with each of the patterns, in left-to-right
          order. When it finds the first pattern that matches the value, <code>match</code> will
          call that pattern&rsquo;s corresponding function and return the result of that call. If
          none of the patterns match the value, <code>match</code> will throw an exception like
          this: <codeBlock>throw new Error('match failed');</codeBlock>
        </p>
        <h3>Patterns</h3>
        <p>
          A pattern in our DSL serves two purposes:
          <ul>
            <li>It tells you whether it matches a value.</li>
            <li>
              <sidebar>
                A function&rsquo;s <code>length</code> property tells you the number of arguments it
                expects. E.g., <code>((x, y) => x + y).length</code> evaluates to <code>2</code>.
              </sidebar>
              On a successful match, it also breaks down the value into zero or more
              <em>bindings</em> that will be passed as arguments to the pattern&rsquo;s
              corresponding function. Note that the <highlight><em>arity</em></highlight>
              (i.e., the number of arguments) of this function must be the same as the number of
              bindings generated by the pattern. <b>Important:</b> your implementation should throw
              an exception if this is not the case.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a list of the patterns that are supported in our DSL:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The <b>wildcard pattern</b> <code>_</code> matches any value, and produces a single
              binding that is equal to that value.
            </li>
            <li>
              An array of patterns can also be used as a pattern. The <b>array pattern</b>
              <code>[</code><i>p<sub>1</sub></i><code>,</code> <i>p<sub>2</sub></i><code>,</code>
              &hellip;<code>,</code> <i>p<sub>n</sub></i><code>]</code> will match any array whose
              contents are matched by <i>p<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>p<sub>2</sub></i>, &hellip;,
              <i>p<sub>n</sub></i>, and if so, it will produce all of the bindings that were
              produced by its sub-patterns, in order. For example:
              <table>
                <tr>
                  <td>
                    <codeBlock>match(['+', 5, 7],
  ['+', _, _],
    (x, y) => x + y
)</codeBlock>
                  </td>
                  <td style="font-size: 14pt;"> 
                    evaluates to <code>12</code>.
                  </td> 
                </tr> 
                <tr>
                  <td>
                    <codeBlock>match(['+', 5],
  ['+', _, _],
    (x, y) => x + y
)</codeBlock>
                  </td>
                  <td style="font-size: 14pt;"> 
                    throws a <em>match failed</em> exception because there is no value to be matched
                    by the second <code>_</code> pattern.
                  </td>
                </tr> 
                <tr>
                  <td>
                    <codeBlock>match(['+', 5, 7],
  ['+', _],
    (x) => x
)</codeBlock>
                  </td>
                  <td style="font-size: 14pt;"> 
                    throws a <em>match failed</em> exception because there is no pattern to match
                    the <code>7</code>.
                  </td>
                </tr> 
              </table> 
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>predicate pattern</b>
              <code>pred(</code><i style="margin: 3pt;">f</i><code>)</code>, where <i>f</i> is a
              one-argument function, matches any value <i>v</i> for which
              <i>f</i><code>(</code><i>v</i><code>)</code> is
              <sideBar>
                A value <code>v</code> is <em>truthy</em> if <code>v == true</code>.
              </sideBar>
              <highlight><em>truthy</em></highlight>. On a successful match, a predicate pattern
              produces a single binding that is equal to the value that was matched. For example,
              if <code>isNumber</code> is defined as follows,
              <codeBlock>function isNumber(x) {
  return typeof x === 'number';
}</codeBlock>
              then <codeBlock>match([1, 2],
  [pred(isNumber), pred(isNumber)],
    (x, y) => x + y
);</codeBlock>
              should evaluate to <code>3</code>.
            </li>
	    <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                The <b>class pattern</b> <code>instof(</code><i>C</i><code>,</code>
                <i>p<sub>1</sub></i><code>,</code> <i>p<sub>2</sub></i><code>,</code>
                &hellip;<code>,</code> <i>p<sub>n</sub></i><code>)</code>, where
                <highlight><i>C</i> is a class</highlight><sideBar>
                   In other words, <i>C</i> is a constructor function that is declared either
                   directly or via the <code>class</code> syntactic sugar.
                </sideBar>, matches any value <i>v</i> for which both
                <i>v</i> <code>instanceof</code> <i>C</i> is <code>true</code> and
                <i>C</i><code>.prototype.deconstruct.call(v)</code> matches the pattern
                <code>[</code><i>p<sub>1</sub></i><code>,</code> <i>p<sub>2</sub></i><code>,</code>
                &hellip;<code>,</code> <i>p<sub>n</sub></i><code>]</code>.
                On a successful match, a class pattern produces all of the bindings produced by
                <i>p<sub>1</sub></i><code>,</code> <i>p<sub>2</sub></i><code>,</code>
                &hellip;<code>, </code> <i>p<sub>n</sub></i>, in order.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                Every class should have a <code>deconstruct</code> method that takes no arguments
                and returns an array of values which constitute the &ldquo;public view&rdquo; of
                an instance of the class. The default implementation of this method, in
                &ldquo;class&rdquo; <code>Object</code>, should return the empty array &mdash;
                <b>it is your responsibility to define this method</code></b>. Other classes may
                override <code>deconstruct</code>. For instance, the <code>deconstruct</code>
                method of <code>Cons</code> in our example is defined as follows:
                <codeBlock>Cons.prototype.deconstruct = function() {
  return [this.head, this.tail];
};</codeBlock>
                In other words, it returns an array containing the head and tail of the receiver.
                This allows the <code>zip</code> method to recursively pattern match on the
                structure of a list.
              </p>
              <note>
                Internal DSLs often define special APIs as hooks into the host language. Here,
                the <code>deconstruct</code> method gives the implementer of a class
                control over how instances are exposed when they&rsquo;re used in pattern matching.
                Note that this <em>view</em> of the object does not have to correspond to its
                representation. For instance, the author of a <code>Point</code> class may choose to
                represent points with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties, but
                <code>deconstruct</code> each point as a pair of (angle, radius) values.
              </note>
            </li>
            <li>
              A limitation of the array patterns described above is that the programmer has to
              statically know the size of the array being matched. To make array patterns more
              flexible, we introduce the <code>many(</code> <i>p</i> <code>)</code> pattern, which
              can only appear directly nested inside an array pattern. This pattern matches zero or
              more values that are matched by <i>p</i> and produces <i>k</i> bindings, where
              <i>k</i> is the number of bindings produced by matching against <i>p</i>. The
              <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> binding produced by <code>many(</code> <i>p</i> <code>)</code>
              is an array of the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup> bindings produced from each of the matches
              against <i>p</i>. For example:
              <table>
                <tr>

              The somewhat unusual &ldquo;column-oriented&rdquo; array of bindings returned by a
              <code>many</code> pattern ensures that the number of bindings produced can be
              statically determined, independent of the number of values that end up matching the
              pattern at run time. For example, the pattern <code>[many([_,_])]</code> always
              generates two bindings.<sup style="color: #aaa;">*</sup>
              <sidebar>
                <sup style="color: #aaa;">*</sup> Note that this is true even when the
                <code>many</code> pattern matches no values. Handling this case properly
                may require some special support in your implementation.
              </sidebar>
            </li>
            <li>
              Any other value &mdash; e.g., <code>42</code>, <code>'foo'</code>, and
              <code>undefined</code> &mdash; can be used as a <b>literal pattern</b>, i.e.,
              a pattern that matches any value that is equal (<code>===</code>) to it. Literal
              patterns don&rsquo;t produce any bindings.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep in mind that <code>match</code> is just a regular JavaScript function, which means
          that its arguments will be evaluated before any pattern matching actually happens. This
          includes patterns like <code>many(pred(isNumber))</code>: they are plain old JavaScript
          expressions that will be evaluated to values before entering the <code>match</code>
          function.

                Both of these extra credit assignmens are eligible for the CS237A extra project
                requirement, <em>as long as your design and/or implementation is sufficiently
                interesting</em>. Feel free to talk to the instructors in advance to verify that
                this is the case.

              Extend our DSL with support for JSON / object patterns. This is as much of a design
              exercise as it is an implementation exercise: you&rsquo;ll have to figure out a nice
              way to expose this feature to the programmer (i.e., what should an object pattern
              look like?) and implement it.

              Design a better internal DSL for pattern matching in JavaScript. You don&rsquo;t
              necessarily have to implement it, although doing so might get you some extra points.
              Either way, you&rsquo;ll have to convince us that your design really is better!
